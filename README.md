## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Key Insights
- **44% customers buy KP281**, 33% KP481, 22% KP781.  
- **Males** are 3x more likely to buy **KP781** than females.  
- **Younger customers (18–28)** prefer KP281; **older/high-income customers (30–40)** go for KP781.
